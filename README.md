### Grant Park Neighborhood ðŸ‘‹

Grant Park is a historic neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia. Craftsmen built many of the architecturally distinctive homes you see today, with construction reaching its zenith around 1905. You'll find unpaved alleys in the back of the houses, from the days when the city sewerage wagons emptied the outhouses. Today we have indoor plumbing!
